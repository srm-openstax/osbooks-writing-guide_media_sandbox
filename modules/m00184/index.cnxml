    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para id="para-00001">This handbook is a brief yet comprehensive reference for you to consult as you write papers and other assignments for a college course. You can refer to it as you draft paragraphs and polish sentences for clarity, conciseness, and point of view. You can read it to learn how to identify and revise common sentence errors and confused words. You can use it to help you edit your writing and fine-tune your use of verbs, pronouns, punctuation, and mechanics. And you can have it open as you integrate and cite quotations as well as other source material in your papers in MLA or APA style.</para>
    <para id="para-00002">Designed as a reference tool, the handbook is organized to help you get answers to your questions. You do not need to read the entire handbook to get helpful information from it. For example, if your instructor has noted that you need to work on comma splices, you can refer to <link target-id="sect-00003" document="m00184">Sentence Errors</link>, before you turn in a final draft of your writing. If you know you frequently misuse commas, refer to <link target-id="sect-00008" document="m00184">Punctuation</link>, and check your sentences against the advice there. And if you, like many writers, can’t remember which punctuation marks go inside and outside quotation marks, refer to <link target-id="sect-00010" document="m00184">Quotations</link>. Becoming familiar with the handbook and the various topics will allow you to use it efficiently.</para>

    <title>Paragraphs and Transitions</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Paragraphs help readers make their way through prose writing by presenting it in manageable chunks. Transitions link sentences and paragraphs so that readers can clearly understand how the points you are making relate to one another. (See <link document="m00104">Editing Focus: Paragraph and Transitions</link> for a related discussion of paragraphs and transitions. See <link document="m00007">Evaluation: Transitions</link> for a related discussion of transitions in multimodal compositions.)</para>
    <section id="sect2-00001">
    <title>Effective Paragraphs</title>
    <para id="para-00004">Paragraphs are guides for readers. Each new paragraph signals either a new idea, further development of an existing idea, or a new direction. An effective paragraph has a main point supported by evidence, is organized in a sensible way, and is neither too short nor too long. When a paragraph is too short, it often lacks enough evidence and examples to back up your claims. When a paragraph is too long, readers can lose the point you are making.</para>
    <section id="sect2-00002">
    <title>Developing a Main Point</title>
    <para id="para-00005">A paragraph is easier to write and easier to read when it centers on a main point. The main point of the paragraph is usually expressed in a <term id="term-00001">topic sentence</term>. The topic sentence frequently comes at the start of the paragraph, but not always. No matter the position, however, the other sentences in the paragraph support the main point.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect2-00003">
    <title>Supporting Evidence and Analysis</title>
    <para id="para-00006">All the sentences that develop the paragraph should support or expand on the main point given in the topic sentence. Depending on the type of writing you are doing, support may include evidence from sources—such as facts, statistics, and expert opinions—as well as examples from your own experience. Paragraphs also may include an analysis of your evidence written in your own words. The analysis explains the significance of the evidence to the reader and reinforces the main point of the paragraph.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">In the following example, the topic sentence is underlined. The supporting evidence discussed through cause-and-effect reasoning: comes in the next three sentences. The paragraph concludes with two sentences of analysis in the writer’s own words.</para>
    <quote id="quote-00001">
    <para id="para-00008"><emphasis effect="underline">Millions of retired Americans rely on Social Security benefits to make ends meet after they turn 65.</emphasis> According to the Social Security Administration, about 46 million retired workers receive benefits, a number that reflects about 90 percent of retired people. Although experts disagree on the exact numbers, somewhere between 12 percent and 40 percent of retirees count on social security for all of their income, making these benefits especially important (Konish). These benefits become more important as people age. According to Eisenberg, people who reach the age of 85 become more financially vulnerable because their health care and long-term care costs increase at the same time their savings have been drawn down. It should therefore come as no surprise that people worry about changes to the program. Social Security keeps millions of retired Americans out of poverty.</para>

    <title>Opening Paragraphs</title>
    <para id="para-00009">Readers pay attention to the opening of a piece of writing, so make it work for you. After starting with a descriptive title, write an opening paragraph that grabs readers’ attention and alerts them to what’s coming. A strong opening paragraph provides the first clues about your subject and your stance. In academic writing, whether argumentative, interpretative, or informative, the introduction often ends with a clear <term id="term-00002">thesis statement</term>, a declarative sentence that states the topic, the angle you are taking, and the aspects of the topic the rest of the paper will support.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">Depending on the type of writing you’re doing, you can open in a variety of ways.</para>
    <list id="list-00001" list-type="bulleted">
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Open with a conflict or an action.</emphasis> If you’re writing about conflict, a good opening may be to spell out what the conflict is. This way of opening captures attention by creating a kind of suspense: <emphasis effect="italics">Will the conflict be resolved? How will it be resolved?</emphasis></item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Open with a specific detail, statistic, or quotation.</emphasis> Specific information shows that you know a lot about your subject and piques readers’ curiosity. The more dramatic your information, the more it will draw in readers, as long as what you provide is credible.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Open with an anecdote.</emphasis> Readers enjoy stories. Particularly for reflective or personal narrative writing, beginning with a story sets the scene and draws in readers. You may also begin the anecdote with dialogue or reflection.</item>

    <para id="para-00012">Betty stood outside the salon, wondering how to get in. It was June of 2020, and the door was locked. A sign posted on the door provided a phone number for her to call to be let in, but at 81, Betty had lived her life without a cell phone. Betty’s day-to-day life had been hard during the pandemic, but she had planned for this haircut and was looking forward to it: she had a mask on and hand sanitizer in her car. Now she couldn’t get in the door, and she was discouraged. In that moment, Betty realized how much Americans’ dependence on cell phones had grown in the months she and millions of others had been forced to stay at home. <emphasis effect="underline">Betty and thousands of other senior citizens who could not afford cell phones or did not have the technological skills and support they needed were being left behind in a society that was increasingly reliant on technology</emphasis>.</para>

As society becomes increasingly dependent on technology, social service agencies, religious institutions, medical providers, senior centers, and other organizations that serve the elderly need to be equipped to help them access and become proficient in the technologies essential to their daily lives.</para>

Like a main clause, a subordinate clause has a subject and verb; however, unlike a main clause, it cannot stand alone as a sentence. A subordinate clause punctuated as a sentence is a type of sentence fragment. The subordinate clauses in the following sentences are underlined.</para>

    <para id="para-00122"><term id="term-00022">Point of view</term> refers to the vantage point from which a story, event, report, or other written work is told.

    <title>APA Documentation and Format</title>
    <para id="para-00642">Disciplines in the social sciences—psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, social work, and often education—use the APA name-and-date system of documentation.

    <item>All material borrowed from sources is cited in the text of a paper by the author’s name, date of publication, and page numbers (if available).</item>
